        <p >Hi! :) My name is Mihir and I am a fourth year student at UCLA studying Linguistics and Computer Science.
          Currently I am working in the field of Cybersecurity but my other interests include _,
          _, and the intersection between Computer Science and Linguistics. I am currently looking for a job in the computer science field.

          <br><br>
          Outside of class I enjoy teaching as part of the <a href="https://www.uclaacm.com/">ACM Teach LA</a> program and performing
          research with the <a href="http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/">Speech Processing and Auditory Perception Lab</a>.

          <br><br>
          In my free time I enjoy playing saxophone (for the past 9 years), relearning gymnastics (also learning calisthenics), reading, playing video games, and as of late
          running.
